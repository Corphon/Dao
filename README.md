# Dao System

## Project Overview

The Dao System is a simulation framework inspired by the Daoist concept of "Dao begets One, One begets Two, Two begets Three, Three begets all things". It aims to demonstrate the self-organizing behavior and diversity of nature by simulating the evolution of complex systems. This project adopts a modular architecture that supports flexible extensions and efficient parallel computing.

## Core Philosophy

The core philosophy of Daoism is the natural self-organization and evolution process. This project embodies this philosophy through the following layers to simulate the evolution of complex systems:

1. **Dao begets One**:
   - Defines the basic units and state management, including state definitions, cell management, and basic computations.

2. **One begets Two**:
   - Handles environmental interactions and dynamic evolution, including environment modeling, periodic changes, and state updates.

3. **Two begets Three**:
   - Responsible for global system analysis and simulation, including grid creation, system behavior analysis, and result statistics.

4. **Three begets All Things**:
   - Responsible for visualization, logging, and user interaction, including graphical rendering, log recording, and UI interfaces.

## Features

- **Cell Behavior Modeling**: Define and simulate the behavior of individual cells.
- **Environmental Interaction**: Model how the environment affects cells and their interactions.
- **Grid Management**: Efficiently manage and update the state of a grid of cells.
- **Event System**: Handle events and interactions within the simulation.
- **Parallel Computing**: Utilize a worker pool for efficient parallel computation.
- **Visualization**: Render the simulation in real-time for analysis and presentation.
- **Analytics**: Collect and analyze metrics from the simulation.
